       "  '* Fatigue and debility   Assessment & Plan - Edited by yursul, mordrick, rn at 6-1-2021  4:01 PM  Patient is a 72 year old male with history of non-ischemic cardiomyopathy with severely reduced EF, ESRD on HD, hypertension, CVA, prostate cancer s/p treatment that presented to hospital for fatigue and inability to care for himself at home. Laboratory studies showed hyponatremia, elevated AG, normal potassium, BUN 27, no leukocytosis or anemia, normal lactate, elevated bilirubins, elevated troponin. CXR showed retrocardiac opacity. CT chest showed no acute changes. He was placed in observation status to general medical unit for further management.     1. Fatigue and debility. Most likely due to end-stage disease including heart and renal failure. He was just discharged from rehab facility and now back in hospital because he is unable to take care of himself.  Patient is interested in talking with hospice. Hospice consult was placed. Patient is not a candidate for hospice given that he would like to continue dialysis. PT/OT and social work consulted as well.  Plan for DC to penn university after evaluation by vascular surgery. I was notified by nephro that his fistula is not functioning properly.   2. Chronic systolic CHF, stable. EF 10-15%. Continue lisinopril.   3. Elevated troponin. It is chronically elevated from heart failure.   4. Hx of CVA.   5. Hypertension, controlled.   6. ESRD on HD MWF. Nephrology consulted. He received dialysis today but nephro concerned that fistula is not functioning properly. Vascular consult placed.   7. Chronic anemia, stable.   8. Chronic wounds to lower extremities. Continue wound care.     Echo:  Summary:  \\xa01. Ejection fraction is estimated to be 13% in the range of 10 - 15%. Severely reduced LV ejection fraction.  \\xa02. Left ventricular cavity size is normal. LV wall thickness is mildly increased.  \\xa03. There was severe hypokinesis of the entire left ventricle wall.  \\xa04. LV diastolic function parameters are indeterminate and LV diastolic filling pattern shows E/A fusion.  \\xa05. Moderately enlarged right ventricle and severely reduced global RV systolic function.  \\xa06. Estimated PA pressure is 41 mmHg. Mildly elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure.  \\xa07. Moderately dilated right atrium.  \\xa08. Mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.  \\xa09. Mild to moderate aortic regurgitation.  10. Pleural effusion in the left lateral region.

      " Thank you for providing the progress note on this patient. Based on the information provided, I have identified some potential toxicity symptoms related to radiation therapy that may be of concern:\n",
      "1. Gastrointestinal symptoms: The patient has not experienced any abdominal pain, constipation, diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting, which are common side effects of radiation therapy to the pelvic area. However, it is important to monitor these symptoms closely and provide appropriate management strategies to minimize discomfort.\n",
      "2. Hormonal changes: The patient's thyroid function tests show an increase in TSH levels, indicating hypothyroidism. This is a common side effect of radiation therapy to the neck and can lead to fatigue, weight gain, cold intolerance, skin changes, and other symptoms. It is essential to manage hormone replacement therapy appropriately to prevent these complications.\n",
      "3. Genitourinary symptoms: The patient does not report hematuria (blood in urine), which is a common side effect of radiation therapy to the bladder. However, it is crucial to monitor for this symptom closely and address any concerns promptly.\n",
      "Based on the above findings, here are my recommendations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Continue monitoring: Continue to monitor the patient's blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory status, and overall clinical condition at each follow-up visit. Keep track of any new symptoms or concerns and adjust medications as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. Thyroid function testing: Repeat thyroid function tests (TSH, free T4) every 6 months to assess the patient's response to hormone replacement therapy and make any necessary adjustments.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. Radiation-related side effects: Monitor the patient for radiation-related side effects such as gastrointestinal disturbances, fatigue, and hormonal imbalances. Provide appropriate supportive care and referral to specialists if necessary.\n",
      "In conclusion, based on the information provided, there are no immediate safety concerns for this patient. However, close monitoring and management of potential side effects from radiation therapy are crucial to ensure optimal outcomes.\n"

      "3. Fatigue: The patient feels mildly fatigued, which is not uncommon during radiation therapy as it can cause exhaustion and weakness due to the body's response to the treatment.\n",
      "4. Skin changes: Radiation therapy can cause skin changes such as dryness, itching, redness, or rashes in the treated area. These symptoms are usually temporary but can persist after treatment completion.\n",
      "5. Psychological distress: The patient does not report any depression, memory loss, or suicidal ideas, but radiation therapy can affect mental health, leading to anxiety, depression, or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is essential to monitor the patient's psychological wellbeing throughout their treatment course.\n",

       "' This 66-year-old retired cement construction worker returns at my behest for followup of grossly uncontrolled diabetes. He reports that he has been giving himself 10 units every morning and 12 units at night. By his memory, he reports his sugar levels are 117, 129 in the morning, but average approximately 180 in the morning. His lowest fasting glucose level was 107. Before dinner his glucose reading is 159. There were no episodes of hypoglycemia. He was under the impression that he should give  himself Lantus twice a day and has been giving himself 10 units in the morning and slowly up-titrating an evening dose and now gives  himself 12 units before dinner. He otherwise feels well and denies any other problems.    CURRENT MEDICATIONS:  Atorvastatin 40 mg daily,       glipizide 10 mg b.i.d.,      Metformin 1000 mg b.i.d.,  Losartan 25 mg QD, aspirin 81 mg daily.     Lantus 24 units QD.     ALLERGIES:  None.     PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:  Diabetes mellitus type 2, ? hypertension, hyperlipidemia, chest pain, cardiac perfusion scan negative 2012.    Sinus tachycardia--EKG NST,  Echo negative 2019.     Chronic cough--CXR negative 5-2019.    PAST SURGICAL HISTORY:  Negative.     SOCIAL HISTORY:  Retired cement construction worker.  Widowed a few years ago.  Two adult children with grandchildren.  Does not smoke.  Drinks occasionally.  No illegal drugs.  Originally born in an urban area of Mexico.  Widowed, but lives with his daughter and grandchildren.     Recently acquired insurance.     FAMILY HISTORY:  Mother had diabetes, but died of sudden cardiac death.  Father died, unknown cause, age 97.  Patient has 6 brothers, some have diabetes.  He has 1 sister who is healthy.  There is no cancer, deep venous thromboses, stroke, bleeding disorders, or glaucoma in any family member.     REVIEW OF SYSTEMS:  Negative for a hypoglycemic symptoms.    PHYSICAL EXAM:  66-year-old man in no apparent distress, weight 157, pulse 95, blood pressure 139/70. A post breakfast reading in our office is 231.    IMPRESSION:  Diabetes, still poorly controlled. In an effort to simplify his regimen, we will consolidate his Lantus to 22 units daily but since he seems to be consistently somewhat high, we will increase to 24 units daily. The patient still seems unclear how to properly titrate his Lantus [Missing/Unknown content] and I therefore have encouraged him to talk to our diabetic nurse - coach. For now, if his fasting sugar levels are above 140, we will increase the  standing Lantus (Basaglar) an additional 2 units. Follow up with me 4 weeks.      Administratively signed by HIM  '"

He reports that he has been giving himself 10 units every morning and 12 units at night. By his memory, he reports his sugar levels are 117, 129 in the morning, but average approximately 180 in the morning. His lowest fasting glucose level was 107. Before dinner his glucose reading is 159. There were no episodes of hypoglycemia. He was under the impression that he should give himself Lantus twice a day and has been giving himself 10 units in the morning and slowly decreasing that dose by one unit each day, until this week when he increased the dose back to 10 units. He is now taking two shots of Lantus and 12 units of Humulin R in the morning. He has lost weight, approximately ten pounds. The patient has been eating less than normal. He reports a normal diet, although he has been eating less. He has been urinating approximately every two hours, and has had to get up twice in the night to urinate. He has not been drinking as much fluid as usual. He had to stop taking the Metformin 500 mg bid and the Glipizide 5 mg because it was causing his blood sugar to drop too low. He reports his blood sugars are “too low,” and that he has to “eat a candy bar” to increase his sugar. He does not know the name of the candy bar that works for him. When asked if he is still smoking tobacco, he says that he still has an occasional cigarette, but not a pack a day as he used to smoke. He does not know how much he still smokes and does not know what the occasional cigarette means in terms of packs per day. When asked about alcohol, he said he still consumes an occasional beer, but did not report how many on a weekly basis. He denies any recent alcohol abuse. He denies any drug abuse, or any use of illicit medications. When asked about his blood pressure, he said that he takes his blood pressure at home using a home machine and “sometimes it is 180/90, sometimes lower.” He does not report the results of his last blood pressure measurement to the physician. \\nThe physician asks if the patient has been taking his blood pressure medication. The patient reports that he “ran out a few days ago” and has been meaning to get it refilled. He is taking Norvasc and Lisinopril. He denies taking his blood pressure today because he was told to bring in blood pressure readings for several days before his next visit in two weeks. He reports no chest pains, shortness of the breath, or palpitations. He does not report any recent episodes of nausea and vomiting. He denies any recent episodes of diarrhea. He denies any recent episodes of constipation. He reports that he had a “small” breakfast this morning. He does not remember what he ate for breakfast. He does report eating lunch today at 11:00. He ate a hamburger and fries. He does not remember what he ate for lunch today, or if he had a snack in between. He denies drinking coffee or soda today. The physician asks the patient if he has seen the nutritionist yet. He said that when she is available, he will go and see her. He said that the nurse told him she would call him when she is in. The physician tells him that she has already been in and that it would be a good idea to go see her.\\nThe patient says that there are two things he would like to know. The first is how much blood sugar is supposed to be in his urine. He does not know how much is too much. He asks if the nurse could give him a urine sugar chart so that he will know how much is too much. The physician tells him to check his sugar levels three times a day for two weeks and bring back the results. She said that they will give him a chart so he knows how much should be in his urine. When asked about his foot, he says that it still hurts, “but it’s OK.” When asked why he thinks that it hurts, he responds that it has to do with his circulation. When asked what he means by that, he says that he thinks it has do to with his circulation. He says that he does not think it has anything to do with his diabetes. The patient has an appointment with Dr. Smith in two weeks. The patient is to return in three weeks with his sugar charts. The physician asks that the patient return in three weeks.'"

      "This 71-year-old retired painter for Parvason Communications, who built a home in stanford of neurology,  reports posterior neck pain of 1 weeks duration.  this began in the absence of any trauma.  The pain is bilateral on left posterolateral left and posterolateral right pad of the neck and radiates to the proximal shoulder.  There is no radicular pain down the arms there is no loss of sensation down the arms.  Pain is elicited by rotating the head to the left or to the right.    Records from other physicians were reviewed the patient has been seeing a podiatrist for foot pain.  His GI specialists have ruled out cancer as an underlying cause of his iron deficiency.

Imdur caused a headache, but was not a true allergy.  4. Keflex is listed as causing an unspecified reaction, but I cannot verify whether  this is a true allergy.  5.

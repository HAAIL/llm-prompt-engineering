      "This 71-year-old retired painter for Parvason Communications, who built a home in stanford of neurology,  reports posterior neck pain of 1 weeks duration.  this began in the absence of any trauma.  The pain is bilateral on left posterolateral left and posterolateral right pad of the neck and radiates to the proximal shoulder.  There is no radicular pain down the arms there is no loss of sensation down the arms.  Pain is elicited by rotating the head to the left or to the right.    Records from other physicians were reviewed the patient has been seeing a podiatrist for foot pain.  His GI specialists have ruled out cancer as an underlying cause of his iron deficiency.          CURRENT MEDICATIONS:.  1. Aspirin 81 mg q.d.  2. Eplerone 50 mg QD.  3. Lasix 40 mg BID.  4. Lipitor 80 mg q.d.  5. Toprol-XL 50 mg BID.  6. Omeprazole 20 mg BID---taken prn (he is not taking it now).  7. Zantac 150 mg QHS.  8. Finasteride 5 mg QD.  9. Tylenol #3 BID prn----starting today..  10. Lupron 30 mg IM---given  12/21/2013.  11. Sildenafil 20 3-5 tabs prn.  12. Depo-Provera  13. Fosamax 70 mg Q Week.--------Started 10/30/12.---he stopped taking this before 1 year.--restarted  2013/21/12      ALLERGIES:  1. Prinivil caused a cough.  2. Antivert was temporarily held because of his tendency towards urinary retention,  but he is not truly allergic to it.  3. Imdur caused a headache, but was not a true allergy.  4. Keflex is listed as causing an unspecified reaction, but I cannot verify whether  this is a true allergy.  5. Cozaar was held after years of use when he developed lip angioedema-------angioedema continued after stopping this drug-------a questionable association-..  6. Quinolones---relatively contraindicated given his aneurysms.    PAST MEDICAL HISTORY:      Coronary artery disease, triple-vessel, with a very long LAD  lesion, medical management preferred. Stress-echo 22-01-2012 showed 7 mets, ischemic EKG changes but no wall motion changes.  Echocardiogram 1-21 shows a patent foramen ovale with right-to-left shunt.   Dobutamine echocardiogram in 1-22-2003 showed  normal valves, ejection fraction 63%, LAD ischemia.      Hypertension.       MRI in 1997/01/21 showed a lacunar stroke,      syncopal episodes with a positive tilt table test in 2005/21/01,with a repeat episode of syncope a few years ago and 12/22/2007..        Prostate cancer---Gleason 8, PSA=11.9 in 2005-22-11. Lupron  In progress.. Abd-Pelvic CT 11/22/2005 shows no metastases, renal stones.  Radiation therapy to prostate completed.  MRI 3-22-2005 shows no extracapsular spread, Bone scan 01/22/05 shows  skull lesion---Head CT shows stable but expansile lytic lesion parietal area 4-22-06------f/u PSA = 0 in 12-22-2007.  . Osteopenia from treatment----bone density T-2.0, Z-0.9---Fosamax started 12-22-2007.      Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia with AV malformation of the lung and recurrent epistaxis.   Thoracic CT 12-22-2007 (pulmonary embolism protocol) shows  LLL A-V malformation,----embolization pending.       Thyroid nodules, --thyroid U/S shows complex nodules---  bx benign 22-12----f/u due 22-12.       Ascending aortic aneurysm--4.4 cm----next CT due 8-22-2007.  Splenic artery aneurysm.     Renal stones---Left hydronephrosis --- ESWL--failed---ureterascopy with stone retrieval pending.    CT renal stone protocol 1-22-07 shows left hydronephrosis, pulmonary AV malformation, abd aortic aneurysm 2007-02-22.     Iron deficiency-- colonoscopy  tubular adenomas in 2007 january 22nd, EGD with biopsy shows nonbleeding AVMs. Enteroscopy---non-bleeding AVMs, 2019.  next colonoscopy due in 2012-01-22.      Fasting blood sugar 112/hemoglobin A1c 6.1.      L4-L5  nerve root compression, status post laminectomy with residual left footdrop,       Venous Doppler negative in 1-22-2022.       Hyperlipidemia,    right inguinal hernia, recurrent urinary tract obstruction with right epididymo-orchitis with Pseudomonas, treated with TURP, cystoscopy otherwise negative in 1-22-2028.     Severe sleep apnea--CPAP used..  Angioedema---anti-IgE fc receptor antibody negative.    Pharyngeal abscess with sepsis.    PAST SURGICAL HISTORY: Appendectomy, hernia repair, L4-L5 laminectomy, TURP. No  surgical bleeding complications,or deep venous thromboses during any of his  previous operations.    SOCIAL HISTORY: He is retired as a painter for Parvason Communications. Married to Hoj, Psychiatry. Two  daughters, one son. He came in to this country from PHARMACY OF JFK in 35-01-22. Smoked, but  quit 23 years ago. Drinks alcohol occasionally. No illegal drugs.  Daughter is Penny and Emmanuelle.  Lives in STANFORD HOSPITAL  in a few months each year.    FAMILY HISTORY: Mother died with coronary artery disease and dementia at age 89.   Mother's siblings have late onset dementia.   Father  died with a lacunar stroke in his 70s. The patient has one brother with a possible  CABG at age 59. He has two sisters, one of whom has unspecified heart disease  after possible syncope a few years ago and now has a pacemaker.   2nd sister is healthy. Daughter has nosebleeds and AV malformation----strong suspicion for Hereditary Hemorrhagic Telangiectasia.  Grandson has nosebleeds.    There is no cancer,  diabetes, deep venous thromboses, aneurysms,  in the family.     Physical exam---limited because this was a telephone visit but the patient did not sound in significant distress but he verbally reported pain with rotating his head to the left into the right.    IMPRESSION     musculoskeletal posterior neck pain.  Tylenol No.  3 1 tab b.i.d. as needed.  If there is not substantial improvement within 1 week, I made him promise that he would make an appointment to see me.\n",

This observation suggests an infection and potential communication between the graft and the skin, indicating a fistula. Additionally, the patient reports that this was noticed after completing a course of antibiotics, which further supports the presence of an infection. The patient was advised to be admitted to the hospital for IV antibiotics and exploration of the hematoma due to concern for communication with the AVG. However, the patient refused admission.

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

However, it is important to note that the patient's vital signs include blood pressure measurement taken from the right upper arm instead of the left arm where the surgery was performed. This suggests that the left arm might be experiencing issues with circulation due to the newly created fistula. Additionally, the healthcare provider has provided instructions for the patient to check for a thrill daily, which further supports the existence of a functioning arteriovenous fistula. Overall, these findings point towards the presence of a fistula.\n",

The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

Firstly, the patient has recently experienced atrial fibrillation, which is a type of cardiac arrhythmia that can be life-threatening if not managed promptly. The patient's chest score is 2 and age over 75, which increases the risk of complications. The note recommends anticoagulation and discusses options, including Apixaban, which the patient will consider. The patient has been started on metoprolol.

However, one symptom that could potentially signal urgency is 'positive for urgency' under the genitourinary section of the review of systems. This could indicate urinary urgency, which might require prompt medical attention.

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

Based on the context, your label can be Yes, if Cystitis is undoubtedly stated or suggested in the text; No, if Cystitis isn't mentioned or implied; and IDK, if the suggestion of Cystitis in the note is unclear or ambiguous. For the explanation part, identify and elaborate the specific elements in the note that directed you towards the selected label. Please remember, the concept of Cystitis can appear in a multitude of ways - as a confirmed diagnosis, potential risk factor, potential side effect, or within varied medical contexts such as radiation cystitis or hemorrhagic cystitis.

As you evaluate every segment of the note, consider the comprehensive medical situation it outlines. Represent your findings in a JSON response that incorporates two key elements: \"label\" and \"explanation\". Your label should be Yes, No, or IDK - assign Yes if the text affirmatively implies Cystitis; No if Cystitis isn't pointed out or inferred; and IDK if the allusion to Cystitis in the note is vague or uncertain. Your explanation should include a reference to the precise sections of the note that guided your chosen label. Bear in mind, Cystitis could be presented in a variety of forms - a confirmed diagnosis, a potential risk factor, a potential side effect, or as part of various medical situations like radiation cystitis or hemorrhagic cystitis. Ensure to validate if a concrete diagnosis of Cystitis is furnished in the text before concluding on a label. In the event that a definite diagnosis is not provided but the presence of cystitis is suggested, assign the IDK label and clearly specify the reason for such ambiguity in the explanation.

The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

      "        LLM2's reasoning: The clinical note contains several indications of the concept 'Urinary obstruction'. Firstly, the patient has a history of 'Prostate cancer' and 'Unspecified hyperplasia of prostate without urinary obstruction and other lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS)', which can potentially lead to urinary obstruction. Secondly, the patient is prescribed 'tamsulosin (FLOMAX) 0.4 mg Cp24', a medication typically used to treat symptoms of an enlarged prostate, such as difficulty in beginning the flow of urine. Lastly, during the physical exam, the note mentions that the 'Prostate is smooth and benign-feeling prostate.. No masses.' However, the presence of 'umbilical hernia' could also suggest potential urinary obstruction, as it can sometimes be a symptom of this condition. Therefore, the score is '1' indicating strong indications pointing to the concept or symptoms similar to Urinary obstruction.\n",

The patient's history of prostate cancer and the note mentioning 'difficulty urination' and 'abdominal pain' are concerning for possible urinary obstruction. This is further supported by the workup results, including a CT scan showing 'extensive mass of retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy' and 'bilateral ureteral obstruction'. The patient's treatment includes 'bilateral percutaneous nephrostomy for management of his urinary obstruction', which was done to improve his 'acute renal failure'. Therefore, based on the patient's history, symptoms, and treatment, it can be concluded that there is irrefutable evidence of urinary obstruction.\n",

In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

      "        LLM2's reasoning: The provided clinical notes mention various health issues and treatments, but there is no explicit reference to Erectile Dysfunction (ED). However, there are mentions of conditions and treatments that could potentially be linked to ED. For instance, the patient has a history of DVT and is currently on anticoagulation therapy with warfarin and heparin. Long-term use of anticoagulants can sometimes lead to ED due to their effects on blood circulation. Additionally, the patient has a history of prostate cancer and received Lupron (Leuprorelin) treatment. Androgens play a significant role in sexual function, and hormonal therapies like Lupron can cause sexual side effects including ED. However, these potential links are not explicitly stated in the notes, and the patient's current condition does not seem to directly relate to ED. Therefore, the label is 'IDK'.\n",

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

The explanation should clarify how you have processed the context of the notes, interpreted medical terminologies and abbreviations, and identified their relevance to Erectile Dysfunction. The final JSON output should have \"label\" and \"explanation\" as keys. Lastly, it's crucial to consider mentions of medications or therapies that are commonly connected to the cause or treatment of Erectile Dysfunction.

The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement.

The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

The note states 'Colonoscopy did reveal friable mucosa consistent with radiation proctitis.' This indicates that the patient has had proctitis in the past, specifically radiation proctitis, which is a known side effect of radiation therapy. The note also mentions that the patient is still experiencing'small volume blood per rectum', which could be a current symptom of the proctitis. However, without a specific mention of present proctitis, we cannot definitively say that the patient currently has this condition. The note does indicate that the patient will be followed up with gastroenterology, which suggests ongoing management of this condition.\n",

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction.

      "System Prompt: Your task is to prompt engineer for another Large Language Model called LLM2, aimed at refining its performance in clinical symptom extraction. The objective is for LLM2 to accurately score single clinical symptoms in clinical notes, focusing on a specified target symptom. The effectiveness of LLM2's output is determined by comparing its extracted symptom labels with ground truth labels. In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement. Adjust the prompt to enhance LLM2's accuracy: for lower accuracy levels, propose more significant and creative changes that address both the extraction and reasoning processes; for higher accuracy, focus on fine-tuning and subtle improvements that refine LLM2's reasoning and label extraction. The goal is to align LLM2's output and reasoning more closely with the ground truth. Please return the revised prompt as a JSON value, key 'new_prompt'.\n",

In addition to the extracted labels, LLM2 now provides reasoning behind its answers. Your duty involves analyzing both the extracted labels and the underlying reasoning to identify areas of improvement.
